The following files have been modified from the standard
Antlr 2.7.2 release:

antlr/antlr.g - Modified to only build AST's for the ebnf.bnf
          portion of the grammar
          
antlr/Tool.java - changed to output the SQL for the input grammar
antlr/Version.java - added '-pt' to the project_version string

The following file was added:

antlr/PTPopulatorAST.java

And all the other files are the same as the standard 
Antlr 2.7.2 release.  The needed files were taken from
the antlrall_jar_FILES target in antlr-2.7.2/Makefile.
