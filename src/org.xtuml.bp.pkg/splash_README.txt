To update the copyright year:
------------------------------
_- Open splash.xcf in GiMP
_- Edit the text in the copyright layer to have the right year
_- Export the file to BMP, overwriting the splash.bmp here

Eclipse has a problem with the BMP output by GiMP, so now:
_- Open the BMP with MS Paint
_- Save the file as splash.bmp, overwriting the existing splash.bmp
_- Commit the files
