This plugin is the container for the model compiler user guide information
available inside BridgePoint Help.

The files doc.zip, techpub.css, and toc.xml are just blank files in CVS.  The
actual versions of these files are copied in by the BridgePoint release process
before this plugin is built as part of the BP build.  The blank files are 
required so that we can specify the files are part of the plugin on the "Build"
page of the plugin.xml view.
